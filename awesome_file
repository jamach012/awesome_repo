This file is awesome. I wish I could push it to the remote repo. It has been difficult because I think I had a merge conflict. Basically, I made the CLASSIC mistake of forgeting to pull from the remote repo BEFORE creating/editing and adding to the local repo. In the end I had to delete everything and start from scratch after realizing my error. In my defense the directions listed creating an online repo last. I'm not sure if it's possible to create a file and push it all to GitHub, there must be a way.
